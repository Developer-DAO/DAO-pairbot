# Run the Pairbot

To run the Pairbot locally you will need open up your terminal and navigate to the Pairbot's directory. Inside you will need to run the following command:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

Thanks to [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) you won't need to restart you server each time you make a change. It will automatically detect any file changes and restart the Pairbot.
