# Developers

To see any developers that are available to pair use the `/developers` command.

<div align="center">
    <img class="default-border"  src={useBaseUrl("/img/commands/developers.png")} alt="Developers Command" />
</div>
<br/>

As you can see, the first drop down menu is already filtered by people who are available. You can change this by checking all the developers in the pairhub database. The second drop down menu will allow you to select different people and see their developer profile. The buttons at the bottom are for pagination.

<div align="center">
    <img class="default-border"  src={useBaseUrl("/img/commands/developers-list.png")} alt="Developers List Command" />
</div>
